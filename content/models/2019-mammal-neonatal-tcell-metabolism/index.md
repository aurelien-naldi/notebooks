The low response to infection in neonatal T cells contributes to a high
incidence of morbidity and mortality. Here we evaluated the effect of the
cytoplasmic and mitochondrial levels of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) of
neonatal CD8+T cells on their low activation. This model captures the
interplay between antigen recognition with ROS and metabolic status in T cell
responses. This model displays alternative stable states, which corresponds to
different cell fates, i.e. quiescent, activated and anergic, depending on ROS
status.
