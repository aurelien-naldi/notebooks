We have applied the logical modelling framework to the regulatory network
controlling T-lymphocyte specification. This process involves cross-
regulations between specific T-cell regulatory factors with factors driving
alternative differentiation pathways, which remain accessible during the early
steps of thymocyte development. Many transcription factors needed for T-cell
specification are required in other hematopoietic differentiation pathways,
and are combined in a fine-tuned, time-dependent fashion to achieve T-cell
commitment.  
Using the software GINsim, we integrated current knowledge into a dynamical
model, which recapitulates the main developmental steps from early progenitors
entering the thymus up to T-cell commitment, as well as the impact of various
documented environmental and genetic perturbations. Our model analysis further
enabled the identification of several knowledge gaps.
