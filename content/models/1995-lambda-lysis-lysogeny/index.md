A number of bacterial and viral genes take part in the decision between lysis
and lysogenisation in temperate bacteriophages. In the case of the
bacteriophage lambda, at least 5 viral regulatory products (CI, Cro, CII, N
and CIII) and several bacterial genes are involved (see {{<cite "models/45">}}
for an excellent overview).


For the sake of explanation clarity, we proceed in two steps. We present a model
of the core of the lambda regulatory network, constituted by the cross-regulation
between the regulatory genes CI (encoding the repressor) and Cro
(see [phage2.zginml](phage2.zginml)).
In a second step, we propose a four element model 
(see [phageLambda4.zginml](phageLambda4.zginml)), encompassing
the roles of the regulatory genes CII and N in addition of CI and Cro.


Note that in {{<cite "models/46">}}, we considered a modified version of the four component
model: [phage4 (alternate).zginml](phage4_alternate.zginml).
This paper deals with the Petri net representation of logical models. The versions
of the two and four component models of the phage lambda switch are available in the
form of Petri nets (INA format).
