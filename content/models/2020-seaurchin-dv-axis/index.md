We have integrated novel experimental results with previous data about the
roles of Nodal and BMP pathways in early development of Paracentrotus lividus
in the form of a regulatory graph, which was complemented with logical rules,
thereby enabling the simulation of cell responses to varying signalling inputs
along the dorsal-ventral axis. This logical model was then extended to account
for ligand diffusion and enable multicellular simulations, which accurately
recapitulated gene expression in wild type embryos, accounting for the
specification of the three main ectodermal regions, namely ventral ectoderm,
ciliary band and dorsal ectoderm, and further recapitulated sophisticated
mutant phenotypes. Finally, using a stochastic extension of the logical
formalism, we performed more quantitative temporal simulations, which revealed
a dominance of the BMP pathway over the Nodal pathway, and pointed to the rate
of Smad activation as a key parameter for D/V patterning of the embryo.

of all the analyses (to be used with the colomoto-docker image).
