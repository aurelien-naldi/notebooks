Here we evaluated the effect of the cytoplasmic and mitochondrial levels of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) of neonatal CD8+T cells on their low activation. This model captures the interplay between antigen recognition with ROS and metabolic status in T cell responses. This model displays alternative stable states, which corresponds to different cell fates, i.","link":"/notebooks/models/2019-mammal-neonatal-tcell-metabolism/","process":["T-cell activation"],"taxon":["Mammal","Human"],"title":"Contribution of ROS and metabolic status to neonatal and adult CD8+ T cell activation"},{"date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","description":"Logical modeling has proven suitable for the dynamical analysis of large signaling and transcriptional regulatory networks. In this context, signaling input components are generally meant to convey external stimuli, or environmental cues. In response to such external signals, cells acquire specific gene expression patterns modeled in terms of attractors (e.g. stable states). The capacity for cells to alter or reprogram their differentiated states upon changes in environmental conditions is referred to as cell plasticity.","link":"/notebooks/models/2014-mammal-th-differentiation/","process":["Differentiation"],"taxon":["Mammal","Blood cells","T lymphocytes"],"title":"Control of Th1/Th2/Th17/Treg/Tfh/Th9/Th22 cell differentiation"},{"date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","description":"We have integrated novel experimental results with previous data about the roles of Nodal and BMP pathways in early development of Paracentrotus lividus in the form of a regulatory graph, which was complemented with logical rules, thereby enabling the simulation of cell responses to varying signalling inputs along the dorsal-ventral axis. This logical model was then extended to account for ligand diffusion and enable multicellular simulations, which accurately recapitulated gene expression in wild type embryos, accounting for the specification of the three main ectodermal regions, namely ventral ectoderm, ciliary band and dorsal ectoderm, and further recapitulated sophisticated mutant phenotypes.","link":"/notebooks/models/2020-seaurchin-dv-axis/","process":["Development"],"taxon":["Sea Urchin"],"title":"Logical model of the regulatory network controlling dorsal-ventral axis specification in the sea urchin P. lividius"},{"date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","description":"A number of bacterial and viral genes take part in the decision between lysis and lysogenisation in temperate bacteriophages. In the case of the bacteriophage lambda, at least 5 viral regulatory products (CI, Cro, CII, N and CIII) and several bacterial genes are involved (see [1] for an excellent overview).\nFor the sake of explanation clarity, we proceed in two steps.
